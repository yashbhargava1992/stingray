We are writing a general-purpose timing package for X-ray time series.

Contents
--------

The contents will be:

- make a light curve from event data
- make periodograms in Leahy and rms normalization
- average periodograms
- cross spectra and lags (time vs energy, time vs frequency)
- maximum likelihood fitting of periodograms/parametric models
- bispectra (?)
- cross correlation functions, coherence
- spectral-timing functionality
- Bayesian QPO searches
- power colours
- rms spectra

Installation
-------------

1. Clone our project from github (remember about including --recursive flag due to our submodule(s))::

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray.git

2. Go to already created directory and install all dependencies::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Go back to stingray project directory and execute::

    $ python setup.py install


Documentation
-------------

Is generated using `Sphinx`_. Try::

   $ sphinx-build docs docs/_build

Then open ``./docs/_build/index.html`` in the browser of your choice.
