- Fix a bug when light curve segments contain complex values (`#760 <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/760>`__)

__ https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/compare/v1.0...v1.1

v1.0 (2022-03-29)
---------------------
TL,DR: these things will break your code with v1.0:

- Python version < 3.8
- The ``gtis`` keyword in `pulse/pulsar.py` (it is now ``gti``, without the 's')

New
^^^
- Dropped support to Python < 3.8
- Multi-taper periodogram, including a Lomb-Scargle implementation for non-uniformly sampled data
- Create count-rate spectrum when calculating spectral-timing products
- Make modlation upper limit in ``(Averaged)Powerspectrum`` work with any normalization (internally converts to Leahy for the calculation)
- Implement Gardner-Done normalization (1 for perfect correlation, -1 for perfect anticorrelation) for ``Auto/Crosscorrelation``
- New infrastructure for converting ``EventList`` and ``LightCurve`` objects into Astropy ``TimeSeries``
- New infrastructure for converting most Stingray classes into Astropy ``Table`` objects, Xarray and Pandas data frames.
- Save and load of most Stingray classes to/from many different file formats (``pickle``, ``ECSV``, ``HDF5``, ``FITS``, and all formats compatible with Astropy Table)
- Accept input ``EventList`` in ``DynamicalPowerSpectrum``
- New ``stingray.fourier`` module containing the basic timing products, usable on ``numpy`` arrays, and centralizes fft import
- New methods in ``Crossspectrum`` and ``Powerspectrum`` to load data from specific inputs: ``from_events``, ``from_lightcurve``, ``from_time_array``, ``from_lc_list`` (``from_time_array`` was also tested using memory-mapped event lists as inputs: useful in very large datasets)
- New and improved spectral timing methods: ``ComplexCovarianceSpectrum``, ``CovarianceSpectrum``, ``LagSpectrum``, ``RmsSpectrum``
- Some deprecated features are now removed
- ``PSDLogLikelihood`` now also works with a log-rebinned PDS

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Performance on large data sets is VASTLY improved
- Lots of performance improvements in the ``AveragedCrossspectrum`` and ``AveragedPowerspectrum`` classes
- Standardized use of new fast psd/cs algorithm, with ``legacy`` still available as an alternative option to specify
- Reading calibrated photon energy from event files by default
- In ``pulse/pulsar.py``, methods use the keyword ``gti`` instead of ``gtis`` (for consistency with the rest of Stingray)
- Moved ``CovarianceSpectrum` to ``VarEnergySpectrum`` and reuse part of the machinery
- Improved error bars on cross-spectral and spectral timing methods
- Measure absolute rms in ``RmsEnergySpectrum``
- Friendlier ``pyfftw`` warnings
- Streamline PDS/CrossSp production, adding ``from_events``, ``from_lc``, ``from_lc_iterable``, and ``from_time_array`` (to input a numpy array) methods
- PDS/CrossSp initially store the unnormalized power, and convert it on the fly when requested, to any normalization

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^
- Fixed error bars and ``err_dist`` for sliced (iterated) light curves and power spectra
- Fixed a bug in how the start time when applying GTIs (now using the minimum value of the GTI array, instead of half a time bin below the minimum value)
- Fixed a bug in which all simulator errors were incorrectly non-zero
- Fixed coherence uncertainty
- Documented a Windows-specific issue when large count rate light curves are defined as integer arrays (Windows users should use ``float`` or specify ``int-64``)
- If the variance of the lightcurve is zero, the code will fail to implement Leahy normalization
- The value of the ``PLEPHEM`` header keyword is forced to be a string, in the rare cases that it's a number
- and more!
