Changelog
=========

Not Yet Released
----------------

- Dropped support to Python <3.8
- Multi-taper periodogram, including a Lomb-Scargle implementation for non-uniformly sampled data.
- Upper limits on pulsations in periodograms and Z searches
- New stingray.fourier module containing the basic timing products, usable on `numpy` arrays
- Lots of performance improvements in the `AveragedCrossspectrum` and `AveragedPowerspectrum` classes
- New methods in `Crossspectrum` and `Powerspectrum` to load data from specific inputs: `from_events`, `from_lightcurve`, `from_time_array`, `from_lc_list`
    - `from_time_array` was also tested using memory-mapped event lists as inputs: useful in very large datasets
- New and improved spectral timing methods: `ComplexCovarianceSpectrum`, `CovarianceSpectrum`, `LagSpectrum`, `RmsSpectrum`
- Improved error bars on cross-spectral and spectral timing methods
- Some deprecated features are now removed
- PSDLogLikelihood now also works with a log-rebinned PDS
- PDS/CrossSp initially store the unnormalized power, and convert it on the fly when requested, to any normalization
- Lots of bug fixes
