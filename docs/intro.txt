The Vision
==========

There are a number of official software packages for X-ray spectral fitting (XSPEC, ISIS,
Sherpa, ...). Such a widely used and standard software package does not exist for X-ray timing,
so for now it remains mostly done with custom, proprietary software. During the 2016 workshop
`The X-ray Spectral-Timing Revolution <http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2016/720/info.php3?wsid=720&venue=Oort/>`_,
a group of X-ray astronomers and developers decided to agree on a common platform to develop a
new software package. This software package will merge existing efforts for a timing package in
Python and provide the basis for developing spectral-timing analysis tools, and be structured with
the best guidelines for modern open-source programming, following `the example of Astropy <http://www.astropy.org>`_.
This software will have an easily accessible scripting interface (possibly a GUI) and a public API for
power users. The ultimate goal is to provide the community with a package that eases the learning curve
for advanced spectral-timing techniques, with a correct statistical framework.

Overview of Currently Implemented Methods
=========================================

Currently implemented functionality in this library comprises:

* loading event lists from fits files of a few missions (RXTE/PCA, NuSTAR/FPM, XMM-Newton/EPIC)
* constructing light curves from event data, various operations on light curves (e.g. add, subtract, join, truncate)
* Good Time Interval operations
* power spectra in Leahy, rms normalization, absolute rms and no normalization
* averaged power spectra
* dynamical power spectra
* maximum likelihood fitting of periodograms/parametric models
* (averaged) cross spectra
* coherence, time lags
* cross correlation functions
* r.m.s. spectra and lags (time vs energy, time vs frequency); UNDER DEVELOPMENT
* covariance spectra; UNDER DEVELOPMENT
* bispectra; UNDER DEVELOPMENT
* (Bayesian) quasi-periodic oscillation searches
* simulating a light curve with a given power spectrum
* simulating a light curve from another light curve and a 1-d (time) or 2-d (time-energy) impulse response
* simulating an event list from a given light curve _and_ with a given energy spectrum
* pulsar searches with Epoch Folding, :math:`Z^2_n` test


Future Additions
----------------

We welcome feature requests! If you need a particular tool that's currently not implemented or
have a new method you think might be usefully implemented in Stingray, please :ref:`get in touch <getinvolved>`!

Other future additions we are currently implementing are:

* bicoherence
* phase-resolved spectroscopy of quasi-periodic oscillations
* Fourier-frequency-resolved spectroscopy
* power colours
* full HEASARC-compatible mission support
* pulsar searches with $H$-test
* binary pulsar searches


This Documentation and Additional Resources
===========================================

These pages lay out the documentation for the `Stingray source library <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray>`_.

Aside from the :ref:`api` reference, there are a number of tutorial-style documents covering the core
library as well as a number of sub-modules. These tutorials are built from executable Jupuyter notebooks available
for cloning in a separate `notebooks repository <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/notebooks>`_.

Further spectral-timing functionality, in particularly command line scripts based on the API defined
within Stingray, is available in the package `HENDRICS <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/HENDRICS>`_.
A Graphical User Interface is under development as part of the
project `DAVE <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/dave>`_.

Citing Stingray
===============

If you use Stingray in your data analysis, **please cite us**! Citations are still the main currency
of the academic world, and pointing to citations is *the* best way to help us ensure that Stingray
continues to be supported and we can continue working on it!

Currently, the best way to cite Stingray in papers and other projects is with our
`Astrophysics Source Code Library entry <http://ascl.net/1608.001>`_. Stay tuned for the first version
release later in 2018.

Reporting Bugs and Issues, Getting Help, Providing Feedback
===========================================================

We would love to hear from you! We are writing Stingray to be useful to you, so if you
encounter problems, have questions, would like to request features or just want to chat
with us, please don't hesitate to get in touch!

The best and easiest way to get in touch with us regarding bugs and issues is the GitHub
`Issues page <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/issues>`_. If you're not sure
whether what you've encountered is a bug, if you have any questions or need advice getting
some of the code to run, or would like to request a feature or suggest additions/changes,
you can also contact us via the Slack group or our mailing list.

Please use `this link <https://stingray-slack.herokuapp.com>`_ to join Slack or send
`one of us <https://github.com/orgs/StingraySoftware/people>`_ an email to join the mailing list.


How to get involved
===================

We encourage you to get involved with Stingray in any way you can! First, read through
the `README <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/blob/master/README.rst>`_. Then, fork
the `stingray <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray>`_ and
`notebooks <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/notebooks>`_ repositories (if you need a primer on
GitHub and git version control, `look here <https://www.webpagefx.com/blog/web-design/git-tutorials-beginners/>`_)
and work your way through the Jupyter notebook tutorials for the main modules. Once you've
familiarized yourself with the basics of Stingray, go to the
`Stingray issues page <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray>`_ and try to tackle one! Other ways to
get involved are outlined on the `project ideas <http://timelabtechnologies.com/ideas.html>`_ page,
along with some astrophysical background/motivation. Finally, you can
read `these slides <https://speakerdeck.com/abigailstev/stingray-pyastro16>`_ from an early talk on
Stingray at the Python in Astronomy 2016 conference.

For organizing and coordinating the software development, we have a Slack group and a mailing
list -- please use `this link <https://stingray-slack.herokuapp.com>`_ for Slack or send
`one of us <https://github.com/orgs/StingraySoftware/people>`_ an email to join.
