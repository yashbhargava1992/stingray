Downloading and Installing Stingray
===================================

There are currently two ways to install Stingray:

* via ``conda``
* via ``pip``
* from source

Installing via ``conda``
------------------------

If you manage your Python installation and packages
via Anaconda or miniconda, you can install ``stingray``
via the ``conda-forge`` build: ::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge stingray

That should be all you need to do! Just remember to :ref:`run the tests <testsuite>` before
you use it!

Installing via ``pip``
----------------------

``pip``-installing Stingray is easy! Just do::

    $ pip install stingray

And you should be done! Just remember to :ref:`run the tests <testsuite>` before you use it!

Installing from source (bleeding edge version)
----------------------------------------------

For those of you wanting to install the bleeding-edge development version from
source (it *will* have bugs; you've been warned!), first clone
`our repository <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray>`_ on GitHub: ::

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray.git

Now ``cd`` into the newly created ``stingray`` directory and install the necessary
dependencies: ::

    $ cd stingray
    $ pip install astropy scipy matplotlib numpy pytest pytest-astropy h5py tqdm

Finally, install ``stingray`` itself: ::

    $ pip install -e "."

Installing development environment (for new contributors)
---------------------------------------------------------

For those of you wanting to contribute to the project, install the bleeding-edge development version from
source. First fork
`our repository <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray>`_ on GitHub and clone the forked repository using: ::

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/<your github username>/stingray.git

Now, navigate to this folder and run
the following command to add an upstream remote that's linked to Stingray's main repository.
(This will be necessary when submitting PRs later.): ::

    $ cd stingray
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray.git

Now, install the necessary dependencies::

    $ pip install astropy scipy matplotlib numpy pytest pytest-astropy h5py tqdm

Finally, install ``stingray`` itself::

    $ pip install -e "."

.. _testsuite:

Test Suite
----------

Please be sure to run the test suite before you use the package, and please report anything
you think might be bugs on our GitHub `Issues page <https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/issues>`_.

Stingray uses `py.test <https://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ for testing. To run the tests, go into
the ``stingray`` root directory and execute ::

    $ python setup.py test

If you have installed Stingray via pip or conda, the source directory might
not be easily accessible. Once installed, you can also run the tests using::

   $ python -c 'import stingray; stingray.test()'

or from within a python interpreter:

.. doctest-skip::

   >>> import stingray
   >>> stingray.test()

Documentation
-------------

The documentation including tutorials is hosted on `readthedocs <https://stingray.readthedocs.io>`_
The documentation uses `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_ to build and requires a couple
of extensions (most notably `nbsphinx <http://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.1/>`_ and the
`astropy helpers <https://github.com/astropy/astropy-helpers>`_).

You can build the API reference yourself by going into the ``docs`` folder within the ``stingray`` root
directory and running the ``Makefile``: ::

    $ cd stingray/docs
    $ make html

If that doesn't work on your system, you can invoke ``sphinx-build`` itself from the stingray source directory: ::

    $ cd stingray
    $ $ sphinx-build docs docs/_build

The documentation should be located in ``stingray/docs/_build``. Try opening ``./docs/_build/index.rst`` from
the stingray source directory.
