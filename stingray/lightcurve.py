            A list of tuple with xlabel and ylabel as strings.

        axis : list, tuple, string, default None
            Parameter to set axis properties of Matplotlib figure. For example

        title : str, default None

            Line style and color of the plot. Line styles and colors are

            circles. See `matplotlib.pyplot.plot` for more options.
