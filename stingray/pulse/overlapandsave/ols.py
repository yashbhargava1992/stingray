# Fast-convolution via overlap-save: a partial drop-in replacement for scipy.signal.fftconvolve

Features:

- 1D and 2D (both tested) and higher (untested) arrays
  - (Currently unsupported is convolving different-dimensional signals)
- Real and complex arrays
- Memory-mapped input/outputs fully supported (and tested)
- Supports alternative FFT engines such as PyFFTW
- Supports reflect-mode (signal assumed to reflect infinitely, instead of 0
  outside its support; useful for avoiding edge effects)
- Relatively straightforward to parallelize each step of the algorithm
- Extensively unit-tested

When it can be used as a drop-in replacement for `fftconvolve`:

- when you call `fftconvolve` with `mode='same'` and `axes=None`
- [See docs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.fftconvolve.html)

Example (culled from unit tests):
```py
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import fftconvolve

# Generate a 100x100 signal array and a 10x10 filter array
nx = 100
nh = 10
x = np.random.randint(-10, 10, size=(nx, nx)) + 1.0
h = np.random.randint(-10, 10, size=(nh, nh)) + 1.0

# Compute the linear convolution using the FFT, keeping the center 100x100 samples
expected = fftconvolve(x, h, mode='same')

# Use overlap-save, computing the output in 6x5-sized chunks. Instead of one huge FFT, we do a
# several tiny ones
from ols import ols
actual = ols(x, h, [6, 5])

# The two will match
assert np.allclose(expected, actual)
```

    For convenience, `lengths` is treated as a *maximum* length in each dimension,
    so `starts + lengths` is allowed to exceed the total size of `x`: the function

    The lists `starts`, `lengths`, `nft`, and `nh` are all required to be the same
    length, matching the number of dimensions of `x` and `hfftconj`.

    """Perform multidimensional overlap-save fast-convolution.

    As mentioned in the module docstring, the output of this function will be
    within machine precision of `scipy.signal.fftconvolve(x, h, mode='same')`.

    However, rather than computing three potentially-large FFTs (one for `x`, one
    for `h`, and an inverse FFT for their product), the overlap-save algorithm
    performs a sequence of smaller FFTs. This makes it appropriate for situations
    where you may not be able to store the signals' FFTs in RAM, or even cases
    where you cannot even store the signals themselves in RAM, i.e., when you have
    to memory-map them from disk.

    `x` and `h` can be multidimensional (1D and 2D are extensively tested), but
    must have the same rank, i.e., `len(x.shape) == len(h.shape)`.

    If provided, the results will be stored in `out`. This is useful for
    memory-mapped outputs, e.g.

    If not provided, `rfftn` and `irfftn` default to those in `numpy.fft`. Other
    implementations matching Numpy's, such as PyFFTW, will also work.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : float/complex array
        This is the array that we need to convolve
    h : complex array
        Filter array. Must have the same rank as x, i.e.
        `len(x.shape) == len(h.shape)`

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    size: list of ints
        List of integers that specifies the sizes of the output that will
        be computed in each iteration of the overlap-save algorithm. It must
        be the same length as `x.shape` and `h.shape`. If not provided,
        defaults to `[4 * x for x in h.shape]`, i.e., will break up the output
        into chunks whose size is governed by the size of `h`.
    lengths: list of ints
        Length of interval in each dimension
    nfft: int
        List of integers that specifies the size of the FFT to be used.
        Its length must be equal to the length of `size`. Each element of this
        list must be large enough to store the *linear* convolution, i.e.,
        `all([nfft[i] >= size[i] + h.shape[i] - 1 for i in range(len(nfft))])`
        must be `True`. Set this to a multiple of small prime factors, which
        is the default.
    nh: tuple of int
        Shape of filter array

    mode : str
        The mode of the convolution. The only accepted modes are
        ``constant`` and ``reflect``. By default, `mode='constant'` assumes
        elements of `x` outside its boundaries are 0, which matches the
