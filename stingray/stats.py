def p_single_trial_from_p_multitrial(pn, n):
    r"""Calculate the single-trial p-value from a total p-value

    Let us say that we want to reject a null hypothesis at the
    ``pn`` level, after executing ``n`` different measurements.
    This might be the case because, e.g., we
    want to have a 1% probability of detecting a signal in an
    entire power spectrum, and we need to correct the detection
    level accordingly.

    The typical procedure is dividing the initial probability
    (often called _epsilon_) by the number of trials. This is
    called the Bonferroni correction and it is often a good
    approximation, when ``pn`` is low: ``p1 = pn / n``.

    However, if ``pn`` is close to 1, this approximation gives
    incorrect results.

    Here we calculate this probability by inverting the Binomial
    problem. Given that (see ``p_multitrial_from_single_trial``)
    the probability of getting more than one hit in n trials,
    given the single-trial probability *p*, is

    .. math ::

        P (k \geq 1) =  1 - (1 - p)^n,

    we get the single trial probability from the multi-trial one
    from

    .. math ::

        p = 1 - (1 - P)^{(1/n)}

    This is also known as Šidák correction.

    ----------
    pn : float

def classical_pvalue(power, nspec):
    """
    Note:
    This is stingray's original implementation of the probability
    distribution for the power spectrum. It is superseded by the
    implementation in pds_probability for practical purposes, but
    remains here for backwards compatibility and for its educational
    value as a clear, explicit implementation of the correct
    probability distribution.

    Compute the probability of detecting the current power under
    the assumption that there is no periodic oscillation in the data.

    This computes the single-trial p-value that the power was
    observed under the null hypothesis that there is no signal in
    the data.

    Important: the underlying assumptions that make this calculation valid
    are:

    1. the powers in the power spectrum follow a chi-square distribution
    2. the power spectrum is normalized according to [Leahy 1983]_, such
       that the powers have a mean of 2 and a variance of 4
    3. there is only white noise in the light curve. That is, there is no
       aperiodic variability that would change the overall shape of the power
       spectrum.

    Also note that the p-value is for a *single trial*, i.e. the power
    currently being tested. If more than one power or more than one power
    spectrum are being tested, the resulting p-value must be corrected for the
    number of trials (Bonferroni correction).

    Mathematical formulation in [Groth 1975]_.
    Original implementation in IDL by Anna L. Watts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    power :  float
        The squared Fourier amplitude of a spectrum to be evaluated

    nspec : int
        The number of spectra or frequency bins averaged in ``power``.
        This matters because averaging spectra or frequency bins increases
        the signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. makes the statistical distributions
        of the noise narrower, such that a smaller power might be very
        significant in averaged spectra even though it would not be in a single
        power spectrum.

    distribution.

    Note that Vaughan+94 gives p(pmeas | preal), while we are interested in
    p(real | pmeas), which is not described by the NCX2 stat. Rather than
    integrating the CDF of this probability distribution, we start from a
    reasonable approximation and fit to find the preal that gives pmeas as
    a (e.g.95%) confidence limit.

    As Vaughan+94 shows, this power is always larger than the observed one.
    This is because we are looking for the maximum signal power that,
    combined with noise powers, would give the observed power. This involves
    the possibility that noise powers partially cancel out some signal power.

    Eq. 10 in Vaughan+94 and `a_from_ssig`: they are equivalent but Vaughan+94

    this function returns a.
